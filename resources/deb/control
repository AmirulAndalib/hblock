Description: Improve your security and privacy by blocking ads, tracking and malware domains
 This POSIX-compliant shell script, designed for Unix-like systems, gets a list
 of domains that serve ads, tracking scripts and malware from multiple sources
 and creates a hosts file (alternative formats are also supported) that prevents
 your system from connecting to them.
